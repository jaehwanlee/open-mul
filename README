 How to build MUL Controller on Ubuntu ?

1. Get necessary packages 

    a) For Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS, the following packages should be installed :
   
       > sudo apt-get install flex bison libwxgtk2.6-dev build-essential 
         expect g++-multilib tofrodos zlib1g-dev gawk libffi-dev

       Not verified with recent ubuntu versions but should work fine.

    b) Install core packages glib-2.0 (>= 2.32) and libevent (>= 2.0.18):

       i) There is a utility script which should configure and build these 
          packages(but will not install), just, do enough for mul compilation :

        >  cd  SCRIPTS
        >  ./configure_ext_libs 

        OR, 

       ii) One can also download and build/install them separately or by apt-get. 

    c) [Optional for performance] Install google's tcmalloc  

       > sudo apt-get install libtcmalloc-minimal0
    
       Before running MuL,  execute the following :
 
       > export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libtcmalloc_minimal.so.0

2. Configure MuL 

    a) If you used built-in script to download core packages, then one can 
       use the following:

       > ./configure  --with-glib=`pwd`/common-libs/3rd-party/glib-2.32.0/ 
         --with-libevent=`pwd`/common-libs/3rd-party/libevent-2.0.18-stable/ 
        
    b) If you build and install glib and libevent separately, we can simply use:
       > ./configure    ## Pass LDFLAGS and CFLAGS if these are installed in non-
                        ## standard directories.

    c) configure script options :

       > with-l2sw=y     ## Build l2sw module as a separate process (default)

       OR, 
        
       > with-l2sw=m     ## Build l2sw module as a modular entity inside the 
                         ## controller.
3. Build MuL 

   > make 

4. Executable will be built as mul-core/mul

   - You need to run using sudo or as admin.

    Options to use -
    mul -d      : Daemon mode
        -S <n>  : Num of switch threads
        -A <n>  : Num of app threads

5. [Optional if you opt for modules to run as a separate process]

    > cd application/l2switch/

    Executable :  mull2sw
